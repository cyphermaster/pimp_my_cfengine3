public version of my work with cfengine

# The Big Tree

## policy
base files
 * for bootstrap
 * for failsafe

## architectures
That is between the DATA and the CODE
* Various class definitions
* association between groups / contexts

## service catalog
This is CODE
Pure cfengine pieces

## resources
This is DATA
* configurations used by the policies
* flat files, templates, binaries or whatever

## workers
This is CODE
Embedeed functions used by services

## helpers
external scripts used for emulate the behaviour of the User interface
